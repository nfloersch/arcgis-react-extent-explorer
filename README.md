# arcgis-react-extent-explorer
A simple example of using ArcGIS JS API Core with React to explore the map's current extent envelope values. 

Based initially off of the Esri example here: https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples/jsapi-create-react-app/src

Moved to use components instead of hooks.
